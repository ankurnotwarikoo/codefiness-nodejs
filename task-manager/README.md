# Task Manager Node.js

Welcome to Task Manager Node.js! This project provides a simple yet powerful task management system built using Node.js and Express.

## Overview

Task Manager Node.js is designed to streamline task management with a RESTful API, allowing users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks. The project structure includes:

- `app.js`: Entry point of the application. Initializes the Express server and sets up routes.
- `taskcontroller.js`: Defines routes and logic for task operations such as fetching, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
- `constants/`: Contains JavaScript files defining HTTP status codes and response messages.
- `helpers/validator.js`: Provides helper functions for validating task objects and their properties.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with titles, descriptions, and completion status.
- **Read Tasks**: Retrieve all tasks or specific tasks by ID.
- **Update Tasks**: Modify existing tasks' properties or mark them as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the database.

## Getting Started

2. **Install Dependencies**:

3. **Start the Server**:

4. **Interact with the API**:

   Once the server is running, you can use tools like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client to interact with the API endpoints.
